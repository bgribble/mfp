2011-01-29: pyliblo 0.9.1

  * Changed send functions to raise an IOError if sending failed (probaby
    most useful with TCP connections).
  * Lots of code cleanup and deobfuscation.
  * Included unit tests in release tarball.

2010-10-22: pyliblo 0.9.0

  * Support Python 3.x. As a result, pyliblo can no longer be built with
    Pyrex, and requires Cython >= 0.12 instead.
  * Added free() method to Server and ServerThread classes.
  * Added fileno() method to Server and ServerThread classes (thanks to
    Edward George).
  * Prefer read-only properties over getter methods (which still exist, but
    are now deprecated).
  * Added proper docstrings (copied from the HTML docs).
  * The minimum version of liblo required by pyliblo is now 0.26.

2009-11-30: pyliblo 0.8.1

  * Release the Python GIL inside Server.recv().
  * Fixed a possible segfault when the error handler was called from the
  * liblo server thread.

2009-09-13: pyliblo 0.8.0

  * Changed license from GPL 2 to LGPL 2.1 (as did liblo in version 0.26).
  * Added protocol parameter to the Server class. Among other things, this
    allows TCP connections.
  * The minumum version of liblo required by pyliblo is now 0.24.
  * pyliblo can now be built with either Pyrex or Cython.

2009-01-19: pyliblo 0.7.2

  * Fixed all compiler warnings properly in Pyrex, without patching the
    generated C code.
  * Return values of callback functions are no longer ignored, but handled
    as in liblo.
  * The send_osc script can now be run with an explicit type string,
    instead of trying to determine the argument types automatically.

2008-08-03: pyliblo 0.7.1

  * Added manpages for send_osc and dump_osc.

2008-03-03: pyliblo 0.7.0

  * Fixed memory leaks, caused by failure to free() the result of
    lo_server_get_url() and lo_address_get_url().
  * Added parameter to Server.register_methods() to allow registering
    functions of an object other than the server itself.
  * Allow callback functions to have a variable number of arguments (*args).

2007-12-14: pyliblo 0.6.4

  * Avoid creating circular references when using methods as callback
    functions, which in some cases prevented the server object from being
    deleted properly.

2007-08-10: pyliblo 0.6.3

  * Patched the Pyrex-generated code to make it compile without warnings.
  * Always build from the existing C source by default.

2007-07-29: pyliblo 0.6.2

  * Minor code cleanup, hopefully not breaking anything.
  * Somewhat faster conversion of blob data from and to Python lists.

2007-07-07: pyliblo 0.6.1

  * Fixed a bug that caused the floats 0.0 and 1.0 to be sent as boolean.
    Thanks to Jesse Chappell for the patch.

2007-05-20: pyliblo 0.6

  * Added support for sending bundles, optionally with timestamps.
  * Added previously unsupported OSC data types (timetag, midi, symbol,
    true/false/nil/infinitum).
  * New @make_method decorator.
  * Various bugfixes.

2007-04-28: pyliblo 0.5.1

  * Fixed a stupid typo in Server.send().

2007-04-26: pyliblo 0.5

  * Simplified the way arguments are passed to callback functions. For the
    server side, this release is therefore incompatible with previous
    versions!
  * Some more cleanup.

2007-04-02: pyliblo 0.3

  * Added class ServerThread for asynchronous dispatching of incoming
    messages.

2007-04-01: pyliblo 0.2

  * Minor improvements.

2007-02-20: pyliblo 0.1

  * Initial release.

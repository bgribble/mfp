mfp.rpc should wither away and die if I'm lucky. 

I started building it to make a useful layer of rpc-like behavior around
python multiprocessing.  I had to extend it numerous times to allow for
the bidirectional recursive RPC calls that cropped up in MFP usage.
Then finally extend it again to support plain C library interoperability 
for mfpdsp. 

Unfortunately I've by now reimplemented pieces of several json-rpc
packages.  One day I am going to refactor and use one of those.  One
day.

For now, here's the summary of what's going on.  

 - The network architecture concept is that there's a single "hub"
   server that listens for connections on a Unix socket, and multiple
   "remote" clients that connect to the socket.  In terms of classes,
   that means there is one rpc_listener.RPCListener in the hub server,
   and one rpc_listener.RPCRemote on each remote.  
   
 - At the RPC level, there are just peers (no distinction between client
   and server).  There's an instance of RPCHost on each remote and the
   hub that manages the socket IO and request/response cycles. 

 - At the Python application level, you inform the RPCHost that you are
   serving a class for remote-object RPC by calling RPCHost.serve(cls).
   This means that you can create actual instances of the class on this
   host.  Any connected peer can create proxy objects that will cause
   the local creation of such local instances.  
 
 - Classes served for remote-object RPC must be subclasses of
   rpc_wrapper.RPCWrapper and have their API methods decorated with the 
   @rpcwrap decorator.  When you create an instance of the wrapped class
   on a peer that is not serving that class, it causes an instance of
   the wrapped class to be created on either side of the RPC connection.
   The instance on the proxy (remote) side just doesn't actually call
   the body of any methods, it just marshals the arguments into a
   request.Request object and sends them over the appropriate socket
   connection.
